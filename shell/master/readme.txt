Default Shell - by Ramora
This is the default shell for Mark. It's practically duct taped together so if you want to study it for your own purposes, uh,., don't! hahaha
this shell was also redone over a previous iteration, using some of the same assets. buuut i didn't use all of them and i didn't want to take them out, so some of the original ones are still in here. if you see something weird while playing with the ghost tell me where it was please

this next part is mainly for me to read so you can be done here if you want.

surface0 - base pose, overlay intervals over this
surface10 - here so that things don't break. this is where a kero would be.

surface20-23 - tail animation, foreground.
surface150-151 - mouth talking frames. nothing special
surface10xx - Right arms
surface11xx - Left arms
surface2000-2003 - eyes
surface99xx - surfaces strictly for \p[x] coding stuff, aka non-sakura or kero things. absurdly high surface number so i don't confuse myself
