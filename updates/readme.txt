yo, so you installed my ghost. thanks for doing that, i hope you like it. 
do note this guy cusses and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. 
Consider this ghost not OSHA approved, as in, not safe for work. Nothing sexual, but M rated for mature language. so, if you're under 18 i don't recommend this ghost.
cool? cool.
